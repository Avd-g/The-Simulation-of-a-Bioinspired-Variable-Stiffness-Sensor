### Bioinspired Variable Stiffness Sensor (VSS) Simulation

This repository contains a comprehensive MATLAB and Simulink simulation of a bioinspired Variable Stiffness Sensor (VSS), designed based on whisker-like structures (vibrissae). The primary goal is to replicate biological sensing capabilities by modeling and controlling stiffness to interact effectively with contact surfaces.

#### Project Overview:

* **Bioinspired Design:** Mimics the adaptability and sensitivity of vibrissae found in animals.
* **Control and Dynamics:** Utilizes dynamic modeling and PID control to manage stiffness and orientation.
* **Simulation Objectives:** Achieve accurate modeling of open-loop and PID-controlled closed-loop systems.

#### Implementation and Key Features:

* **Dynamic System Modeling:**

  * Developed a planar rigid-body model governed by two axial actuators controlling precise positioning and rotation.
  * Defined by dynamic equations, linearized for effective implementation and analysis.

* **PID Control Integration:**

  * Incorporated PID controllers to manage the angular position accurately.
  * Initially utilized provided PID parameters (Kp=0.545, Ki=0.474, Kd=0.157) and refined to optimized values (Kp=1, Ki=1.7, Kd=0.5).

* **Linearization and State-Space Representation:**

  * Applied feedback linearization techniques for simplification and accurate control design.
  * Managed system complexity through structured subsystem designs within Simulink.

* **Simulation Parameters and Conditions:**

  * Precisely defined parameters such as vibrissa length, mass, spring stiffness, actuator radii, damping coefficients, and more.
  * Introduced realistic disturbances and desired outputs through sinusoidal waveforms and pulse inputs.

* **Trajectory and Torque Analysis:**

  * Compared open-loop and closed-loop responses, documenting discrepancies and performance characteristics.
  * Analyzed torque signals and output displacements for validation against reference signals.

* **Model Validation and Analysis:**

  * Conducted comparative analyses under varied force conditions to validate the consistency of system responses.
  * Documented the sensor's ability to adjust dynamically, demonstrating fundamental whisker-like behavior and adaptation.

#### Results and Conclusions:

* Successfully simulated open-loop and closed-loop responses, capturing the essential behavior of the bioinspired VSS.
* Identified areas for further refinement and detailed potential avenues for incorporating advanced techniques such as deep learning for enhanced accuracy.

#### Future Enhancements:

* Integration of deep learning methodologies to improve system response accuracy.
* Enhanced modeling to include three-dimensional dynamics and real-world application scenarios.

This project demonstrates the robust potential of bioinspired sensors for sophisticated tactile sensing and interaction, providing a solid foundation for continued research and practical application development.
